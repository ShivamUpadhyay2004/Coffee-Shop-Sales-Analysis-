# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis
In this Project I combined the SQL and Power BI to extract insights, design visual dashboards, and enhance my analytical skills. This project provided hands-on experience in data querying, KPI tracking, and interactive reporting, bridging the gap between raw data and meaningful business decisions.

**Project Overview:**
The objective of this project was to analyze sales performance data and derive key insights using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The focus was on building a dynamic dashboard that allows users to interact with the data and understand business trends effectively.
Problem Statement & Business KPIs:
To optimize sales strategies, I designed and analyzed the following key performance indicators (KPIs):
ðŸ“Œ Total Sales Analysis â€“ Examining monthly sales trends, revenue fluctuations, and percentage growth.
ðŸ“Œ Total Orders Analysis â€“ Tracking the volume of orders over time to identify demand patterns.
ðŸ“Œ Total Quantity Sold Analysis â€“ Understanding product demand and inventory needs.
ðŸ“Œ Average Order Value (AOV) â€“ Evaluating revenue per transaction for profitability insights.
ðŸ“Œ Customer Segmentation Analysis â€“ Categorizing customers based on purchase behavior.
ðŸ“Œ Sales Performance by Region â€“ Comparing sales across different locations.

**Power BI Dashboard Features & Visualizations:**
To translate insights into an interactive dashboard, I incorporated:
âœ… Calendar Heat Map â€“ A color-coded representation of daily sales trends.
âœ… Line & Bar Charts â€“ Monthly trends of total sales, orders, and revenue.
âœ… KPI Cards â€“ Quick-glance view of total sales, order count, and AOV.
âœ… Slicers & Filters â€“ Enabling dynamic selection of time periods and product categories.
âœ… Drill-Through Functionality â€“ Allowing deeper exploration of individual sales transactions.
âœ… Geographical Map â€“ Visualizing sales distribution across different regions.

**ðŸ”¹ SQL Queries & Techniques Used:**
To extract and transform the data efficiently, I applied various SQL concepts, including:
âœ” Aggregate Functions â€“ SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() for KPI calculations.
âœ” Joins & Subqueries â€“ Combining multiple tables for a comprehensive dataset.
âœ” CTEs (Common Table Expressions) â€“ Simplifying complex queries for readability.
âœ” Window Functions â€“ Using ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and LEAD()/LAG() for trend analysis.
âœ” Case Statements â€“ Categorizing data dynamically.
âœ” Date & Time Functions â€“ Extracting insights based on time-based trends. 

**Key Takeaways & Learnings:**
ðŸ”¹ Improved understanding of SQL-based data extraction for analytics.
ðŸ”¹ Hands-on experience in Power BI dashboard creation with interactive elements.
ðŸ”¹ Enhanced ability to identify business trends and insights from raw data.
ðŸ”¹ Strengthened data storytelling skills for data-driven decision-making.
